# BY-GEN
BY-GEN is an addon created for Blender 2.8 to assist with generative modeling workflows. It allows for both the generation of new objects and the modification of pre-existing objects, to create interesting and unpredictable generative styles.

# The Interpreter
The Interpreter is a feature that allows users to be able to store modifier stacks (including generated textures) as text-based data inside of Blender's text editor. Modifier stacks can then be reconstructed on other objects by reading from one of these generated text files. This can be done by using the fields available in the Interpreter box of the 'BY-GEN - Tools' panel.
